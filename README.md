A simple, correct PEP 517 build frontend.

See the [documentation](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

### Installation

`build` can be installed via `pip` or an equivalent via:

```console
$ pip install build
```

### Usage

```console
$ python -m build
```

This will build the package in an isolated environment, generating a
source-distribution and wheel in the directory `dist/`.
See the [documentation](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for full information.
