.. _PR #304: https://github.com/pypa/build/pull/304

Breaking Changes
----------------

- As a side-effect of `PR #260`_, projects not containing either a ``pyproject.toml`` or ``setup.py`` will be reported as invalid. This affects projects specifying only a ``setup.cfg``, such projects are recommended to add a ``pyproject.toml``. The new behavior is on par with what pip currently does, so if you are affected by this, your project should not be pip installable.
- The ``--skip-dependencies`` option has been renamed to ``--skip-dependency-check`` (`PR #297`_)
- The ``skip_dependencies`` argument of ``build.__main__.build_package`` has been renamed to ``skip_dependency_check`` (`PR #297`_)
- ``build.ConfigSettings`` has been renamed to ``build.ConfigSettingsType`` (`PR #298`_)
- ``build.ProjectBuilder.build_dependencies`` to ``build.ProjectBuilder.build_system_requires`` (`PR #284`_, Fixes `#182`_)
